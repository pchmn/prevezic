# Prevezic - Collaborative Event Photo Sharing

## Project Overview

Prevezic is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for collaborative photo sharing at private events. It enables event organizers to create photo collection projects and invite participants to contribute photos through a simple, mobile-friendly interface.

## Core Concept

The app revolves around **Projects** - private photo collections for specific events (e.g., "Anniversaire Paul", "Wedding Reception", "Birthday Party"). Each project acts as a collaborative space where multiple people can contribute and view photos.

## Key Features

- Anyone with the link can join the project as a member
- No complex registration process - seamless onboarding via invitation links

### Photo Contribution
- Members can add photos by taking pictures directly with their phone camera
- Native camera integration for optimal mobile experience
- Photos are instantly uploaded and shared with all project members

### Gallery Experience
- All project members can view all uploaded photos in a gallery layout
- Photos are displayed in an organized, visually appealing grid
- Click/tap to open photos in fullscreen view for better detail
- Smooth, responsive interface optimized for mobile and desktop
